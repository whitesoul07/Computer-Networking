1 ***Network Interface Card***
 ( Ethernet card, network card, LAN card, Network Adapter Card(NAC) )
  -> Its a physical layer and data link  devices which computer use to connect other device in LAN network .
  
   i) MAC Address -> (Media Acess Control Address) hardware identification number that uniquely identified each devices on a network.(6 byte number)

2 ***WI-FI Card***
-> used to connect any device to local network wirelessely.

 i) Wifi accessing point-> (WAP) physical area of network which provides internet access through wifi also known as wifi hotspot.

3 ***HUB***
-> it is a device which has multiple ports use connect multiple computers of LAN together.

 i) Passive HUB - allow signal to pass without any change.
 
 ii) Active HUB -> increase the strength of signal as it moves from one device to another.

 -> HUB is not secure and safe  as copying the data packets on all the interfaces make it slower and more congested.

 -> HUB sends data in byttes.

 -> it connects devices with same network and store MAC Adresss.

4 ***Switch***
-> Switch do the same work of HUB  but in more   filter and forwarding way.

-> when a packet is deliver to switch it checks the address and many more things and transfer the packet to the right device.(Packet Switching Technique)

-> Switch sends data in Frames.

-> It connect devices with network and store MAC Adress.

5 ***Router***
->It is a **Network Layer Device**. It routes data packet based on IP Address.

->Router sends message in Packets.

-> It connects two Networks and store MAC Adress.

6 ***Bridges***
-> It connects Two or more LANs. operates as a Data link Layer. It handels the network that folow the same protocol.

  **Fuction**

  -> Filtering packets

  -> Forwarding Packets

  -> Blocking packets

7 ***Gateway***

-> connects two or more dissimilar networks.

-> it also acts as a Proxy server, Firewall, Malware protection.

8 ***Reapeater***

-> it is extend transmission so that signal can cover longer distance or be received on the other side of an obstruction.

-> increase the power of ssignal and retransmitted it.

-> In computer networks, a repeater is used to increase the network's reach, restore a damaged or weak signal, or provide access to inaccessible nodes.
